# structuralCircle

The repository contains data, tests and solutions related to the research project at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

The **structuralCircle** project is about aiding the design process with reclaimed building components. In particular, the algorithm is matching available products to the design intent, aiming at environmental impact minimization.  

The solution is written in Python and for the ease of use wrapped into a Grasshopper nodes available for Rhino users. 
 
The implementation includes greedy algorithms, bipartite graphs, and mixed integer linear programming.

Test data contains simulated sets of building elements. The aim of test cases is to compare score - reduction of embodied emissions, and speed of the calculation.
